**Last Updated: November 18, 2025**

## Overview

NotebookLM Markdown Exporter ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our data practices for the Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The Extension operates entirely locally within your browser. Specifically:

- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personally identifiable information
- **No Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the extension
- **No Conversation Data**: Your NotebookLM conversations are processed locally and never sent to external servers
- **No Cookies**: We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- **No Third-Party Services**: We do not integrate with any third-party analytics or tracking services

## How the Extension Works

The Extension:

1. **Runs Locally**: All processing happens in your browser using JavaScript
2. **Reads Page Content**: Only accesses NotebookLM chat pages (https://notebooklm.google.com/*)
3. **Converts to Markdown**: Transforms HTML to Markdown format using the Turndown.js library
4. **Downloads Files**: Saves the converted content as a `.md` file to your device
5. **No External Communication**: Does not make any network requests or transmit data outside your browser

## Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the content of the current NotebookLM tab when you click the export button
- **host_permissions** for `https://notebooklm.google.com/*`: To run the extension only on NotebookLM pages

These permissions are used exclusively for the export functionality and nothing else.

## Data Storage

- **No Server Storage**: We do not operate any servers or databases
- **Local Files Only**: Exported Markdown files are saved directly to your computer's download folder
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not sync or backup your data to any cloud service
